"7","90","The Guardian (UK)","Alexis Soloski","November 14th, 2016","When the dancers are leaping, the accordions wheezing, the lights flashing, the skirts swirling, and the vodka flowing, then 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812' feels thrillingly unlike anything else on Broadway...The combinatory musical style is perhaps too eclectic, yet also undeniably invigorating <U+2013> like a shot of horseradish vodka.

"9","90","DC Theatre Scene","Jonathan Mandell","November 14th, 2016","Extraordinary, the freshest, most inviting show on Broadway this season. 'Great Comet' is awesome in its stagecraft, in its music, and in its performances...Director Rachel Chavkin and set designer Mimi Lien in particular deserve kudos for staging on Broadway something very close to the kind of immersive theater that<U+2019>s lately been intriguing theatergoers all over the world <U+2013> everywhere but Broadway, until now.",""

Benton<U+2019>s Natasha is charming and bubbly yet when her liaison with Anatole is shattered, she fails to move us.",""
"11","65","Front Row Center","Tulis McCall","December 2nd, 2016","The talent here is mighty. Across the board. The story, however, could have been condensed into a tight 90-minute extravaganza. As it is, the themes are repeated over and over and over<U+2013>and not in nuanced ways. Repetition overcomes talent as well as spectacle and wears the listener down...To be sure this is a visual spectacle that you rarely see on Broadway. Without the spectacle, however, the story does not stand up.",""
"12","75","Talkin' Broadway","Matthew Murray","November 14th, 2016","More often than not it succeeds at making a great time, even if it falls short of making great art...Though I remain an admirer of 'Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812,' I find that its flaws are even more evident now, and Chavkin and Malloy are not able to disguise how hard they're working...Malloy walks a thin line between serious adaptation and rib-poking irony, and does not always get the ratios correct...Ultimately more a triumph of style than it is a classic piece of writing.",""
"13","55","The Wall Street Journal","Terry Teachout","November 17th, 2016","For all its explosive liveliness, Ms. Chavkin<U+2019>s staging looks like a hopped-up concert version of a musical, not a bona fide Broadway show, and it serves mainly to paper over the essentially undramatic nature of 'The Great Comet,' which feels less like an opera than a cantata...There<U+2019>s more than one way to write a show, and I freely acknowledge the extreme cleverness and originality of 'The Great Comet.'

It<U+2019>s quiet, lovely, emotional.",""
"15","80","AM New York","Matt Windman","November 14th, 2016","Since it premiered, I have always found the show to be extremely uneven, with a stop-and-start momentum that alternates between all-out liveliness and long episodes of slow tedium. That being said, Rachel Chavkin<U+2019>s stunning production is an intoxicating whirlwind of wild activity...Benton, a little-known actress, is wonderful as the doe-eyed Natasha, and Groban, with his rich voice in tow, gives a sensitive performance that fully captures Pierre<U+2019>s angst-filled personality.",""
"16","95","The Hollywood Reporter","David Rooney","November 14th, 2016","It arrives on Broadway in superlative shape, its humor, emotional content and rip-roaring storytelling every bit as vibrant as its madly infectious score...No disrespect to the marvelous cast, many of whom have been with the project since its earliest stages, but the true stars are the material and production, which is often as cinematic as it is blazingly theatrical...Chavkin's direction is a marvel of intricacy, with simultaneous action happening in multiple spots...Don't miss it.",""
"17","60","New York Magazine / Vulture","Jesse Green","November 14th, 2016","If 'Natasha' used this gorgeousness to set up a contrast with the characters<U+2019> turpitude, or to bring its world crashing down at the end, it might seem less vapid...Groban sings not just beautifully but without irony; almost alone among the cast he makes real connections to the ideas behind the words...The misalignment of source and style is so severe in 'Natasha' that it seems like an example of elitist decadence rather than the condemnation of it that Tolstoy intended.",""
"18","80","New York Daily News","Joe Dziemianowicz","November 14th, 2016","That immersive world has been realized ingeniously on Broadway...The large talented cast delivers the goods in director Rachel Chavkin<U+2019>s lively staging and there<U+2019>s much to admire in Molloy<U+2019>s wistful arias and rowdy beats.

"21","85","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","November 18th, 2016","Malloy's sung-through lyrics are clear as any play dialogue and propel the narrative most effectively. And Chavkin has guided the performers to make their situations and feelings easily comprehensible...Electro-pop-influenced and sung-through like an opera, but it also, and beautifully, blends in Russian folk and classical music...They've managed to give audiences a view of Tolstoy's rather overwrought romantic subplot through a contemporary and often humorous and unique lens.",""
"22","80","Chicago Tribune","Chris Jones","November 14th, 2016","A wildly inventive new musical...'Great Comet' functions as a satire of the trope of turning Russian fiction into musicals...The weakness of Chavkin's fabulously staged production is pretty simple and obvious.

"25","70","The Wrap","Robert Hofler","November 14th, 2016","'War and Peace' is a lot of story to tell in one musical. But why leave out its ending when 'The Great Comet' meanders rather aimlessly for the first 45 minutes ...While there are occasional dollops of levity in Malloy<U+2019>s lyrics, Chavkin never stops spoofing his material, which is the major saving grace of this 'Comet.' Throughout the evening, clever bits of thespian business, as well as unobtrusive audience participation, manage to delight. And distract, in a good way.",""

Far superior to any expectation or imagining I had. He conveys more emotion in 2 bars of a song than some others do in an entire solo. Worth seeing for him alone.4) The production is incredible; The ensemble, including some musicians, dance and play through the theater - they've removed seats and added stages and walkways and tables.

The story covers about 70 pages of Tolstoy, so don't think you get a summary of  War and Peace.  The best seats are the center movable stools (SE 1 to 6). I was so close that I could touch the actors. At one point, I was on stage delivering a letter to Ms. Benton (part of the show). That was fun.

The other challenge is the book/score. Some songs are really great and brilliantly sung.

The production is massive and impressive but actually detracts from the telling of an epic story - the characters are far too two-dimensional, and the first act drags as it tries to set up the story. The second act is far better, but only because something dramatic has happened to pique our interest. The production emulates  Hamilton  with little success.

Just hearing Josh Groban singing Dust & Ashes and playing as part of the orchestra was a well worth treat despite Groban playing a seemingly supporting role. The most memorable and delightful role belongs to Lucas Steele (Anatole) who played the lovable cad with deliberate comic vanity. While his role does not require Sir Olivier standard, he made the entire musical the focus of fun. Another standout is Amber Gray (Helene) who added so much pizazz and sexy diva charm with her beautiful rendition of  Charming  and her shining bad girl presence.

They also continually race up and down stairs from orchestra pit to back of the mezzanine while singing and dancing. Be warned this is cutting edge theatre, despite its historic story line. This is what I look for in a theatre experience but it may not be to everyone's taste. Groban's voice is the highlight of the evening but all the cast is engaging and though they warn you of the complicated interrelationships of the characters, in the end things are fairly easy to understand, if you just let it sweep over you.

Maybe I just can't get into the aesthetic, but on more than one occasion, I had trouble connecting characters with their songs.

The Imperial theater has been entirely transformed with the stage winding throughout the audience and even into the upper mezzanine, causing surprises at every turn of the show. This cast delivers dynamic performances, & getting to interact with them is a real treat. While music is catchy, lively, beautiful & packed with emotion, the lyrics & book aren't as solid. Much of the lyrics are actors narrating what they themselves are doing, which is a fun wink at the source material but feels awkward after its repetitive use. In addition, this musical isn't plot-driven, opting instead to concentrate on the emotional experience of the characters. It's really cool but not for everyone.

Not even sitting in the back corner could make an audience member feel excluded from this show; be prepared to ride the wave of the story and its emotions along with the characters - physically and mentally - when you come to see this show. Also - do not fear the Tolstoy element of the show! It's written with the knowledge that Tolstoy can be very inaccessible and dry to the general public - and so the show clearly explains to the audience everything that happens, plot wise.

Josh Groban is sad and beautiful as Pierre, Denee Benton is pure and delightful as Natasha. The whole room is completely enthralled as a Russian salon and it brings you back in time to another world, but you still feel at home in the present. It's all bizarre and delightful! Dave Malloy's lyrics music and book are smart, sexy, indulgent. I can guarantee he will be nominated for a Tony. He even combined text from  War and Peace  (the 70 page portion from which the play comes from) into his own words. Literally, please stop reading my review, buy a ticket, and go see the show.

The woman who plays Natasha was perfect for the role. Her voice is ethereal when she sings. She also maintains that naivety and innocence of Natasha. The only reason why the show didn't get a 100 is because of Dave Malloy. He didn't fit the role of Pierre for me. The age difference he had with the other actors was obvious. In the novel, he is the same age as Andrei. That was not at all plausible. Also, whenever he had a connection with Natasha it was a bit uncomfortable instead of romantic.

I've seen way better Russian folk dancing in Fiddlers On The Roof in their one Russian number. Now the story: I was very much put off by every character and felt detached from the story. Pierre's singing was strong and emotional but didn't contribute much and was forced into the story. Natasha's voice was beautiful but acting seemed forced. All the other characters were one-dimensional and unendearing.
