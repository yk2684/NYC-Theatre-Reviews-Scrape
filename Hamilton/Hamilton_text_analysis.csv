He's created a work sure to be enjoyed by generations to come, proudly drawing on America's past as a guiding light to the future.

Does 'Hamilton' live up to all of this  Well, yes, it actually does...Even though 'Hamilton' is nearly three hours long, it does not feel tedious...As soon as 'Hamilton' ended, I wanted to see it again.

I get that things were simplified in order to create a cohesive and riveting story, though when you go through it point by point, there are A LOT of inaccuracies. I mean, like about 50% inaccurate. The most glaring one that I think could have been worked around easily was showing how Hamilton left the Treasury department. The conveniences they used in this situation are almost cringe-worthy if you've even read one book on the founding of our country. 2. The transitions from song to song are abrupt, almost to the point that you feel they are singing only because it is the next song to sing, not because they are driven to do so. With that said - it is still the best musical in a decade IMHO, though I do like the original performance of Les Miz a little better....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="

But, the musical was so clever, and Lin-Manuel Miranda's writing was brilliant. The lyrics were beautiful, and very well thought out. Also, the original cast is amazing. They have the voices of angels, and their rapping is on point. And off stage, they're hilarious. Especially Jonathan and Lin. Lin-Manuel did an absolutely amazing job on this whole musical. I also got a bit more into history. I had never even heard Alexander Hamilton's name before, and now I could tell you almost anything about him. I think Hamilton is the best musical of all time, and I've seen a few musicals before. My sister is very much into broadway. Lin deserves many awards for this show. And the cast also deserves awards because their acting is amazing. Hamilton has made me smile and laugh when all I wanted to do was cry. I'm actually thankful for Lin, and the rest of the Hamilton cast for making this happen. Hamilton makes my day....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="
