The actors in the band are quadruple threats as they also play the instruments (including Corey who actually learned to play the piano according to his interview with AOL Build). The dancing and singing were phenomenal but I think it might've been a bit too dance-y for my liking. The story line was a bit cliche and predictable in some parts too and I was never really fully engaged and enveloped in the story.
