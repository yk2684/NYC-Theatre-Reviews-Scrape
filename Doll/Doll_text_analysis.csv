"1","90","The New York Times","Ben Brantley","April 27th, 2017","A smart, funny and utterly engrossing new play...Features a magnificent Laurie Metcalf leading one of the best casts in town...Mr. Hnath approaches what might seem like a hubristic project with the humility and avidity of an engaged Everyreader...He has written an endlessly open debate. Which for the record never feels like a debate, such is the emotional commitment of the cast and the immediacy of Mr. Gold<U+2019>s fine, sensitive production.",""
"2","95","Broadway News","Charles Isherwood","April 27th, 2017","So endlessly stimulating that it could give audiences fodder for heated conversation until the fall season is in full swing...Hnath<U+2019>s play fairly sets your head spinning with its knotty perspectives...With a sterling cast led by Metcalf, the production is as much an engrossing entertainment as it is a theatrical treatise that stirs the heart even as it invigorates the mind...Metcalf here delivers what is easily her finest Broadway performance to date<U+2014>and she has never been less than terrific.",""
"3","85","Theatermania","Zachary Stewart","April 27th, 2017","A leap that pays off in delightful and often hilarious ways...Hnath raises deeper questions not just about a certain brand of feminism, but the cult of individualism that is so ingrained in modern society...Director Sam Gold has led everyone in this cast to thoughtful and revelatory performances in an appealingly clean production...Hnath refracts Ibsen through the prism of contemporary life, revealing the complicated spectrum of issues that always existed within the drama.",""
"4","80","BroadwayWorld","Michael Dale","April 29th, 2017","Gold's invigorating production showcases four stellar performances. Metcalf is a master of drawing out comedy that's firmly anchored in realism...Houdyshell's Anne Marie is a dry and stoic presence that deflates Nora's pride in her accomplishments by pointing out the reality she never sees, and Rashad effectively conveys the maturity of a young woman forced to grow up early...This is a play that will no doubt provoke discussion.",""
"5","80","Variety","Marilyn Stasio","April 27th, 2017","Helmer Sam Gold knows his players and right from this first scene pairs them in a series of close encounters that feel like fierce, if friendly wrestling matches...Hnath<U+2019>s dialogue, slangy and vulgar and brightly idiomatic, is full of zingers...Metcalf is amazing, uncovering so many facets to Nora, while retaining the humor to laugh at her idiocies. But by now, we<U+2019>re starting to suspect that this isn<U+2019>t really a play, but a very funny and quite biting manifesto...Nora wins every verbal battle.",""
"6","95","Time Out New York","Adam Feldman","April 27th, 2017","With Lucas Hnath<U+2019>s lucid and absorbing 'A Doll<U+2019>s House, Part 2,' the Broadway season goes out with a bang...Modern in its language, mordant in its humor and suspenseful in its plotting, the play judiciously balances conflicting ideas about freedom, love and responsibility. And Sam Gold<U+2019>s exemplary direction keeps you hanging on each turn of argument and twist of knife. Everything about the production works. It<U+2019>s a slam dunk.",""
"7","80","The Guardian (UK)","Alexis Soloski","April 27th, 2017","Hnath<U+2019>s play is less a conventional sequel than a thought experiment inspired by the original...Hnath writes fast, vibrant dialogue and while Gold inserts a few postmodern touches, he mostly pushes the actors onstage and has them talk things over with hustle and vigor. The performers are excellent, particularly Metcalf...The play succeeds far better as a vivid and playful philosophical exercise than as a character-driven drama...This shouldn<U+2019>t put ticket buyers off.",""
"8","85","New Yorker","Hilton Als","May 1st, 2017","Hnath has now found himself by parsing and filling in a story he didn<U+2019>t write...To go from dreaming about Nora<U+2019>s life to writing it required a leap of faith<U+2014>an author<U+2019>s faith in his own imagination<U+2014>and that<U+2019>s the kind of energy that jumps out at you from Hnath<U+2019>s play, his strongest yet...It was thrilling to feel that the writer and the director weren<U+2019>t condescending to us and assumed we<U+2019>d keep up. We do, because Nora matters to us and will always matter to us.",""
"9","75","Lighting & Sound America","David Barbour","April 28th, 2017","As long as Metcalf and Houdyshell command the stage, armed with Hnath's mordant dialogue, 'A Doll's House, Part 2,' looks like a play that is going places...But Torvald isn't an equal partner at all, dramatically speaking, and Cooper often seems a little overwhelmed by his leading lady...Gold's direction finds every available laugh and bit of insight in Hnath's script; even when it begins to disappoint, there's a baseline level of professionalism below which this production never drops.",""
"10","85","DC Theatre Scene","Jonathan Mandell","April 27th, 2017","A clever, surprisingly amusing and thought-provoking new play performed to winning effect by a quartet of first-rate actors...The main pleasures in 'A Doll<U+2019>s House, Part 2,' are rooted in the chance to watch four accomplished performers...Gold puts the actors<U+2019> performances front and center, often literally.",""
"11","90","Theater Life","David Sheward","May 6th, 2017","Hnath wisely builds on Ibsen<U+2019>s premise but is not enslaved by it<U+2026>This is so much more than a sequel, it<U+2019>s a gripping examination of the ways people try to live together under a restrictive society and what happens when they fail<U+2026>Sam Gold<U+2019>s measured direction injects just the right amount of humor to leaven this living-room war<U+2026>Laurie Metcalf is a strikingly complex Nora<U+2026>Hnath expands on a classic and provides his own insights into the issues it raised over 100 years ago.",""
"12","100","Front Row Center","Tulis McCall","May 2nd, 2017","<U+201C>A stupendous creation in nearly every way<U+2026>Metcalf is beyond brilliant<U+2026>Before you can put up a defense, these characters are there putting down roots in your head and your heart. Sam Gold<U+2019>s direction pulls these extraordinary cast members together into an ensemble that summons the Spirits of the Small Moments to the table to create a banquet. This is a feast all around. 'A Doll<U+2019>s House Part 2' is a reminder of why theatre<U+2013>or art itself<U+2013>is, at its best, a life-altering experience.<U+201D>",""
"13","85","Talkin' Broadway","Matthew Murray","April 27th, 2017","A funny and insightful new play...Although this play could easily have been little more than a schematic continuation of Ibsen's themes, Hnath is more interested in twisting the familiar than regurgitating it...Gold's penchant for subtle emotions, and pointing up the natural ironies that often exist between them, is ideal for this group of people...Gold has done what he does best and amplified every characterization that the excellent cast members have provided him.",""
"14","30","The Wall Street Journal","Terry Teachout","April 27th, 2017","A poorly crafted play<U+2014>I can<U+2019>t remember when I last sat through a lumpier exposition<U+2014>that is not a risky challenge to established belief but a collective celebration of an article of firmly settled faith. 'Part 2' is tensionless...Cooper's three co-stars are outstanding, but they<U+2019>re all well-known quantities on Broadway. Not so Mr. Cooper, who has plenty of stage experience but hasn<U+2019>t appeared in a play since 1985. Let<U+2019>s hope he works his discreet magic again soon<U+2014>preferably in a better show.",""
"15","90","The Huffington Post","Michael Glitz","February 28th, 2017","Unquestionably one of the wittiest, sharpest shows of 2017...A great play given a great production...Spiced with just the right dash of modern language, this is a tour de force of ideas as a trailblazer examines the scorched earth she left behind and is asked if it was worth the price...Like any great play of ideas, 'A Doll<U+2019>s House, Part 2' works precisely because those ideas flow through characters that are deeply human. The cast is excellent.",""
"16","60","AM New York","Matt Windman","April 27th, 2017","The play resembles a 90-minute sketch comedy adapted from an undergraduate essay dissecting Ibsen<U+2019>s play...Director Sam Gold provides a spare production with spirited performances from the four-member cast...As a theater history buff, I found the play interesting, but hardly as engrossing and muscular as Hnath<U+2019>s work from last season. I look forward to seeing more plays by Hnath <U+2014> but hopefully not more sequels.",""
"17","90","The Hollywood Reporter","David Rooney","April 27th, 2017","It delivers explosive laughs while also posing thoughtful questions...Directed with stylish austerity by Sam Gold, the play provides a corker of a role for the indomitable Laurie Metcalf...As much an ingenious elaboration and deconstruction of 'A Doll's House' as a sequel, and it stands perfectly well on its own...In Gold's zesty staging, the lightness of touch in the writing carries through to the direction and performances, nowhere more so than with Metcalf.",""
"18","85","New York Magazine / Vulture","Jesse Green","April 28th, 2017","As directed by the inerrant Sam Gold, Hnath<U+2019>s play is at its core a public forum on questions of marriage that still bedevil us...Hnath provides enough ingenious structure to allow 'A Doll<U+2019>s House, Part 2' to function quite smoothly as an often hilarious puzzle drama...Hnath is not using the preexisting characters and their backstory as ways of avoiding having to create something original; rather, they are springboards to something very new indeed...A great feminist comedy.",""
"19","80","New York Daily News","Joe Dziemianowicz","April 27th, 2017","Hnath<U+2019>s compact and provocative comedy...It's his best work to date...The issues aren't new but presented in intriguing ways...Metcalf, a seasoned stage vet who's known for the sitcom 'Roseanne,' can clown with the best of them. Just saying the word 'no,' Metcalf<U+2019>s face is an avalanche of motion...Nora was<U+2014>and is<U+2014>a woman who bends and breaks rules and lives by her own terms. Fifteen years later, everything and nothing has changed.",""
"20","95","Deadline","Jeremy Gerard","April 27th, 2017","The funniest, and the sharpest play of the year...Hnath<U+2019>s inspired writing, which endows each character with an arsenal of fastballs, curveballs and spitballs, keeping us disarmingly off-balance. He<U+2019>s an uncommonly gifted parodist...Sam Gold<U+2019>s smashing production renders the action, such as it is, and the dialogue slightly off-kilter as these once intimate people tiptoe through a dream in which everyone gets even and nobody wins.",""
"21","85","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","May 1st, 2017","'A Doll House, Part 2' is a completely original work that can entertain and stimulate on its own...For all the talk, there's nothing talky or boring here. The talk is sharp, funny and ripe for exploding into high drama...As portrayed by Laurie Metcalf, Nora is a riveting character...While this breezy one-acter won't topple 'A Doll's House' from the list of great twentieth century plays, it's as amusing and thought-provoking as any sequel can get.",""
"22","85","Chicago Tribune","Chris Jones","April 27th, 2017","Hnath has created a fascinating and frequently very funny little play that is less about the issues raised in 'A Doll's House,' and more about returning to greet your former responsibilities...The other takeaway of this quite compelling little exercise is that acts of revolution can flow from privilege...This really is a multilayered performance: you can see Ibsen's Nora herein, plus the woman Nora became and the compassionate cracks in her armor. And Rashad rises up to meet her.",""
"23","90","Newsday","Linda Winer","April 27th, 2017","The play <U+2014> a psychologically serious, deliciously amusing tragicomedy <U+2014> extends Ibsen<U+2019>s three-act, multicharacter masterwork with just four characters in an intense but surprisingly breezy 90 minutes. But how trenchantly these four are portrayed in director Sam Gold<U+2019>s stark, audacious, daringly acted production...Hnath lets no one off the hook about women, the law and marriage. He also keeps us guessing until the last possible moment.",""
"24","85","The Wrap","Robert Hofler","April 27th, 2017","The highest praise you can give Hnath is that he should now write a sequel to 'Streetcar'...A major miracle of Sam Gold<U+2019>s direction is that each of actor comes from his or her own individual space to do battle. And that conflict of styles galvanizes the play...Hnath keeps defying our expectations...These fine actors<U+2019> very different approaches to their roles are what Hnath<U+2019>s script calls for. That they rub together to produce such humor and warmth is the achievement of a master director.",""
"25","83","Front Mezz Junkies","Steven Ross","April 27th, 2017","Funny and thoroughly engaging...Cooper doesn<U+2019>t manage to rise to the same level as these other two women who command the stage...Metcalf is as incredible as can be. Her body language and stance are fascinating, being modern and old-fashioned at the same time...It resonates far and wide about love and marriage; attachment and parenting; responsibilities to family and to self. It<U+2019>s a fun piece of playful writing, not too deep but it does carry a healthy dose of profoundness.",""

The agility of her acting, the way she can reverse course while making it seem like she<U+2019>s simply following the logic of her character, is a marvel.

The use of modern language is very well done here, and the writing is snappy and funny while simultaneously exploring serious themes.

Written in modern vernacular and set 15 years after Nora slammed the door in Ibsen's original, the only purpose this play serves is to be a mouthpiece for Hnath to say that marriage traps women and ruins their lives because they are forced to erase their identities for that sake of the institution. He also does a small treatise on how men just want to be cared for, so they'll indulge misinformation and create a white lie if it ensures people will cater to their every need. So, the cast is left to more or less sermonize on these topics from the stage and tell us that in 20-30 years marriage will be obsolete and we'll all look back at laugh at how ridiculous the institution is. Sadly, this is said early in the show and the remainder oft he 90 minute one-act is a slow, plotless march towards a final bow where the cast beats the metaphorical dead horse to infinity and beyond.

While the set-design is a bit bland and jarring (with its deep orange carpet), the feel is of a boxing ring, or bull-pen, and it's appropriate. The four-person cast is led by Laurie Metcalf's cynical, self-absorbed Nora. Chris Cooper's Torvald offers perspective on his role as husband, father, and breadwinner--and vulnerable human being--missing from the Ibsen play. Condola Rashad has excellent timing as the neglected daughter Emmy who just may have something to teach her mother. Always-incredible Jane Houdyshell plays loyal-but-opinionated Anne Marie.

Jayne Houdyshell does a great comic relief part, but it would have been nice to see her figure more in the dramatic elements of the show.
