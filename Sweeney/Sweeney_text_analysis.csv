Actors interact with the audience before the show, during the show, and during intermission in the lobby. A couple actors come up to the balcony during Act II but don't interact with audience, so if you don't like the immersive feel, stick to the balcony or the counter on the ground level. Everyone has to leave the pie shop during intermission so they can fix the set. Pie and mash is only available for specific ticket holders and is served prior to the show-- actors walk on the tables so no food can be on the tables during the show.

(It completely obliterates the misguided actors-play-instruments version.) It works because you are there - close up with the actors - and that creates an environment where the dramatic impact of the piece comes through in an intense and riveting way. The two British leads (ALERT: they're leaving) are sensational: Jeremy Secomb and Siobhan McCarthy, the best Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett I've seen since Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury. I'm not sure about the upstairs seating, but if you are at the tables or behind, you'll get that sense of immediacy. Two drawbacks: the table seating is a bit uncomfortable and has various obstructions, but it doesn't really prevent you from experiencing the story.

This production obviously has to limit some scenes because of the small space but they did very original work. All of the table seats face each other, and if I'd been seated there I don't think I'd have been happy having to turn my head around the entire time (since the action happens all around you).
