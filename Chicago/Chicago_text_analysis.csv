"1","100","The New York Times","Ben Brantley","November 15th, 1996","The pulse-racing revival of the musical ''Chicago,'' involves a cast of top-flight artists perfectly mated to their parts and some of the sexiest, most sophisticated dancing seen on Broadway in years...The America portrayed onstage may be a vision of hell, but the way it's being presented flies us right into musical heaven.",""
"2","100","Talkin' Broadway","Matthew Murray","November 14th, 2002","Chicago is as good now as it's ever been--a heartening experience, a life-affirming dedication to the magic and art of theatre, and something that absolutely should not be missed. Though all shows must eventually close, the glory and genius of Chicago should be celebrated while it's here, and with any luck, it will still be gracing and energizing Broadway for many years to come.",""
"3","80","Theatermania","David Finkle","August 4th, 2003","Cynics predicted that the big-screen opus would mean the end of the show's Gotham run, but the opposite has occurred for this Encores!-originated revival...the show is now an SRO proposition. During intermission, audience members may be heard debating the comparative merits of the live and canned treatments.",""
"4","100","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","November 20th, 1996","What it's all about: 'murder, greed, corruption, violence, exploitation, adultery and treachery.' Of course what it's also about is sensational dancing, singing, acting...and, fun! No razzle-dazzle mechanical props, just the razzle-dazzle of a company of gifted performers delivering two hours and twenty minutes of show-stopping numbers.",""
"5","85","Theatermania","Brian Scott Lipton","September 7th, 2006","Broadway's busiest revolving door, better known as the nearly 10-year-old revival of Chicago, has someone new passing through: the R&B superstar with the single moniker of Usher...while he's a good two or three decades younger than most of his predecessors, the tuxedo fits decently enough.",""
"6","95","The Associated Press","Michael Kuchwara","November 18th, 2002","A lot of Broadway musicals don't age very well, but the long-running revival of 'Chicago' seems to have discovered the fountain of youth. The score's catchy melodies are potent, toe-tapping reminders of music from the late 1920s, while the lyrics are snappy, pointed and often very funny.",""
"7","90","Theatermania","Andy Propst","October 22nd, 2011","The Broadway revival of John Kander and Fred Ebb's Chicago, may be on the verge of celebrating its 15th anniversary, but one could hardly tell the production has recently entered the upper echelon of long-running shows on Broadway. There's a crispness to the entire piece of Chicago, that belies its age.",""
"8","95","OoCities","Richard Zoglin","November 25th, 1996","The stunning revival of Chicago that just opened on Broadway ought to win over any doubters. Chicago hasn't merely aged well; it has come of age...A show that doesn't just give us the old razzle-dazzle; it glows.",""
"9","95","New York Daily News","Howard Kissel","November 14th, 1996","Because the revival of  Chicago  is so wildly entertaining, I'm hesitant to call it important, always an ugly adjective for a reviewer to use...What makes this revival important, is that it reminds us that musicals are about songs and performers, not scenery. When you have material and performances as dynamic as this, you don't need chandeliers.",""
"10","100","Variety","Greg Evans","November 23rd, 1996","If the Kander & Ebb style can be described in one word, it<U+2019>s showstopper. And though their detractors might argue that the tenacity can be wearying, they<U+2019>ll find scant support for that position in <U+201C>Chicago.<U+201D> Even in a concert staging, the momentum starts high and gets higher.",""
"11","100","Hello Beautiful","Danielle Young","June 2nd, 2015","Starring alongside Broadway legend, Amra-Faye Wright, Brandy held her own. Her voice sends goosebumps up your spine, or could it be that you know every woman in the cast has killed someone...  Brandy was lovable as the fiendish, but coy criminal. Her acting was spot-on and her voice was the cherry on top. 'Chicago' is exciting, sexy and absolutely ridiculous and taking that ride with Brandy was one of the most enjoyable Broadway experiences I<U+2019>ve had in a long time.",""

The choreography in the movie was much more exciting, and this was very understated. Specifically, the choreography for Cell Block Tango was outright lazy and consisted mainly of the girls running around chairs set up in the middle of the stage, reminiscent of a scantily-clad game of musical chairs. The redeeming number of the show was the original Bob Fosse choreography used for the final number. It would've been better if the two actresses could have stayed together, a mistake many amateur dancers would never dare to make in front of such a large crowd.
