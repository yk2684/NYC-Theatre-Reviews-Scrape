Few mainstream musicals are. But it captures both the milieu it evokes and the colorful characters who populate it with a buoyancy and humor that ultimately won me over.",""

But they haven<U+2019>t dug especially deep in the imagination department, either. 'A Bronx Tale' packs some tasty ear candy and fine performances, but it<U+2019>s as conventional as it gets and could use a surprise or two...While the story unfolds strictly by the numbers, songs by Glenn Slater and Alan Menken lend periodic lifts. Menken is an ace at crafting Zelig-like melodies that evoke a period. Doo-wop and <U+2018>60s pop loom large.",""
"16","90","Times Square Chronicles","Suzanna Bowling","December 10th, 2016","From an outstanding score by Alan Menken, touching and cohesive book by Chazz Palminteri, the effervescent choreography by Sergio Trujillo and an award-winning cast, 'A Bronx Tale' has it all. 'A Bronx Tale' is an old-fashioned musical, done the way musicals used to be with heart, soul and just a little bit of schmaltz. It is exactly what the doctor ordered in these trying times.

I'm  that guy  for rating this musical way below the curve-- but, alas, I just can't help it. Meaning no disrespect for Mr. Palminteri's fine work in writing the play and starring in the movie, the book for A Bronx Tale is just awful. Insipid, vague, clich<U+00E9>-filled writing abounds (all they could find to call a woman with romantic potential is  a great one --you only get three  great ones , by the way; I don't know why). Characters are half-developed, if at all, and contain inconsistencies (the worst of which is that Calogero has some  talent  that is supposed to get him out of the Bronx--but we never find out what it is!). The lyric writing is criminally bad: riddled with clich<U+00E9> after rhyming clich<U+00E9>, and grammatical inconsistencies abound. Menken did what he could, but there's one act of material (the second act is almost entirely reprisals) and the music is pretty anonymous-sounding, save for a nice tune or two.

ROCKY had some spectacular staging - but the score didn't support the story as well as it could have. Not the case here - where believe it or not - the local tough guys batter and bruise, gamble and kill, break into song - and it all works.
