This is light fare geared to amuse. It's also <2 hours with no intermission. Yay!=Also I found Soo very good in Hamilton, but here she is breathtaking. She is also the high point of the show by a significant margin. To the musical's credit, the film is weird and cutesy and borderline creepy (like so many romcoms, eh ) -- and the show hews to that vibe.From singing fish and garden gnomes, to mannequins with nuns' habit and ballgag, this musical is full of whimsy. I almost wish it had committed to rigorous surrealism instead, but c'est la vie. And for all the talk (and there is a lot of talk - and singing) about Zeno's paradox, there is little intellectual meat to this sugarspun musical. The lyrics are plain enough to be incidental, although the music is often lovely.In this end, if you can tolerate the setting, it is completely worthwhile to see Soo act and especially sing Amelie so well....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="

Indeed, there's creativity in abundance in Am<U+00E9>lie, and while a flawed production, it does have its charms. Yet, what makes it as unsuccessful as it could be (why the show is closing early) is because it is for a niche audience. It's too whimsical and fairy-tale-esque, if not nostalgic, to be a show for the more avid, mature theatregoers looking for super-intelligent plots and writing. Yet, it's too risque for younger audiences (with pornography, sex, and other mild yet clear references, this is not a show that a family can attend with young children in tow--or, at least, I would not it). The 2001 film has the right amount of focus on enchantment within real life; this musical tends to lack that focus, as it tries to do too much. Paring down the young-Am<U+00E9>lie bits and focusing on a series of  do-good  events would have been smarter. The cast deserves more....<U+00A0>Read more Read less"

Young Amelie was delightful to get the ball rolling and one new right away that you had to throw all reality out the window and let your imagination take over. The introverted Amelie grows through the show as she delves into working on her social skills and ultimately finding love. The ensemble has some quirky characters who are all holding their own. The music is light, but forgetful for the most part. The multi-facited set acts as many scenes.

It's heart is in the right place (mostly on its sleeve), but unfortunately - not much of it is adequately on display on stage. Phillipa Soo makes a delightful lead - even if she seems to be channeling Audrey Tatou in her dress, manner and every expression from the movie. the rest of the cast is game - and some visual effects and trickery tries hard to duplicate the joyous themes and couplings from the film - but most fall short.

Ms. Soo is charming and physically perfect for Amelie, but I didn't buy the romance between her and Adam Chanler-Berat.

At times the production even detracts from the flimsy story...if you want me to feel something when a significant character dies, and you want me to believe that this event is pivotal in the life of another character, I don't think you can kill that character with a giant balloon.

We get to see her range as an actor in this. Her comedic timing, her voice, and her courage to really let herself be vulnerable all create a complex, endearing, and relatable character. Adam Chanler-Berat complements her perfectly, playing Nino with such ease, authenticity, and matching vulnerability. These two lead an amazing ensemble who each lend an important hand in creating this colorful, whimsical world that Amelie lives in.

The Walter Kerr is an intimate theater, with a balcony that hangs over much of the orchestra.The show itself is about a young girl named Amelie, who loses her mother to a tragic (but rather amusingly-presented) accident. She grows up and ends up working at a restaurant where she meets people and tries to help them. Eventually, she finds someone and in the traditional style of these types of shows, there are fitful starts and stops as she tries to decide if she wants to take a chance on finding her own happiness.The ending was satisfying, and for us a highlight was her interactions with her goldfish, Fluffy. The songs are good and are worth a second, maybe a third listen.Prediction- won't become an institution like  Wicked  or  Phantom of the Opera , but it should enjoy a good run as a great example of light musical rom-com genre....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="
