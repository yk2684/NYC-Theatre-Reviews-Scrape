The light she casts is so dazzling, this seems an entirely sufficient reason to be...What was one of the great stage performances of the 20th century has been reinvented, in terms both larger and more intimate, that may well guarantee its status as one the great stage performances of this century, too...The musical, on the other hand, seems and sounds thin, despite the velveteen lushness of its orchestra.",""

"4","60","Time Out New York","Adam Feldman","February 9th, 2017","Those who go to see Close reprise her celebrated turn in the musical<U+2019>s 1994 Broadway production will not be disappointed...Close holds the stage with a feverish intensity that transcends camp...If only she could be in every scene! For the rest of 'Sunset Boulevard,' adapted from Billy Wilder<U+2019>s timeless 1950 film, is mostly a languorous slog...This is second-rate Lloyd Webber: filler songs that loop and repeat exhaustingly, set to lyrics that often clunk.",""
"5","85","Theatermania","David Gordon","February 9th, 2017","Close delivers as if no time has gone by at all. Joined by a 40-piece orchestra, we're privileged to witness theater history in the making...Price's discombobulating staging, which often features his actors running up and down the Escher stairs to nowhere, doesn't really achieve a feeling of intimacy...All bets are off when Close hits the stage...It's not clich<U+00E9> to say that we can hear a pin drop during each number as she commands the spotlight in triumph.",""
"6","40","New Yorker","Hilton Als","February 20th, 2017","Webber doesn<U+2019>t write music that one can sing without 'soaring'...I never really warmed to the movie that the musical is based on, just as I haven<U+2019>t warmed to the musical: its atmosphere is at once messy and banal; its relentless pop fa<U+00E7>ade and the constant drama of its music preclude intimacy and distance us from feeling, while encouraging a kind of aggressive contempt. None of the characters are truly big, let alone human, even as they play big.",""
"7","80","The Hollywood Reporter","Frank Scheck","February 9th, 2017","Close delivers a more subtle, nuanced performance well suited to a production dramatically scaled down from the original...The lush orchestrations do ample justice to the beauty of Lloyd Webber<U+2019>s score...The book by Christopher Hampton and Don Black is largely faithful to the film, although its lack of nuance sometimes gives the musical an excessively campy feel that thankfully is now lessened...Ultimately, it<U+2019>s Close<U+2019>s return that is this revival<U+2019>s reason for being.",""
"8","60","Lighting & Sound America","David Barbour","February 22nd, 2017","Close's singing has deteriorated significantly...In a way, this works to her advantage, making all the more poignant Norma's stab at regaining her youthful glory, but I wished for more...Lonny Price hasn't been able to rein in certain of his star's occasional excesses...The songs are a random series of hits and misses...'Sunset Boulevard' isn't a great musical, but it's a pretty good vehicle, at least if the right star is on hand. Close's performance is sufficiently titanic to justify this l..",""
"9","65","New York Theater","Jonathan Mandell","February 17th, 2017","'Sunset Boulevard' is ersatz opera of the outsized and mostly overwrought kind that Broadway audiences have been eating up, on and off, since the 1980s. It<U+2019>s noteworthy, then, that this production cast Glenn Close, whose voice is, to put it politely, far from operatic. Her power resides in her acting; her Norma manages, at its best, to be both steely and vulnerable, sinking into herself and dominating everything and everyone. Most of the other cast members hardly register by comparison.",""
"10","70","Theater Life","David Sheward","February 26th, 2017","Not only has Close deepened her interpretation, but Lonny Price<U+2019>s new staging is an imaginative stripped-down retake of Trevor Nunn<U+2019>s gargantuan 1994 edition. Andrew Lloyd Webber<U+2019>s synthetic score and the simplistic book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton still fail to approach the noir nightmare vision of Hollywood created in Billy Wilder<U+2019>s legendary 1950 film. But with Price<U+2019>s more intimate staging, Close<U+2019>s magnificent performance is even more striking.",""
"11","85","Talkin' Broadway","Matthew Murray","February 9th, 2017","Glenn Close makes it look effortless...The songs work together flawlessly, setting up the thesis and then proving it, all the while Close bewitching you as surely as Norma does her cherished 'people in the dark'...Whether 'Sunset Boulevard' is everything a musical is supposed to be is another matter. It plays very well, though in most part because it follows Wilder's prescriptions (and dialogue) closely...Price's attempts at taming this beast are valiant and largely successful.",""
"12","70","Broadway Blog","Samuel L. Leiter","February 17th, 2017","Price's staging, in a fatal mistake, fails to capture the darkness, being surprisingly upbeat, and with only scattered moments of the needed gothic anxiety demanded by the story...Close's...pitchy singing voice is not Broadway's best, but her acting is strong enough, even within the deliberately broad, almost grotesque, theatricality she adopts to jerk tears when she launches into 'With One Look.' But the emphasis on her exaggerations takes the show too far from its deeper implications.",""
"13","70","The Clyde Fitch Report","David Finkle","February 12th, 2017","Frequently Close<U+2019>s unsure of her pitch...As this 'Sunset Boulevard' marches along, it<U+2019>s clear that Close is on hand for the acting and for striding effectively about in the flowing robes and turbans...The whole script is credulity strained....What this 'Sunset Boulevard' does have in its favor is what it always had: the score.

"14","55","The Wall Street Journal","Terry Teachout","February 9th, 2017","Ms. Close<U+2019>s performance, by turns adamantine and childishly needy, is as memorable in its own way as was that of Gloria Swanson in the movie. No, the fundamental problem with turning 'Sunset Boulevard' into a musical is that it is perfect...The truth is that 'Sunset Boulevard' doesn<U+2019>t need songs, or anything else that it doesn<U+2019>t already have in abundance. Saving Ms. Close<U+2019>s presence, to change anything at all is necessarily to diminish the film<U+2019>s overwhelming effect.",""
"15","75","AM New York","Matt Windman","February 9th, 2017","The revival makes a strong case for Lloyd Webber<U+2019>s music (an uneven but bold mix of sweeping romantic melodies, jazz and underscoring) and Don Black and Christopher Hampton<U+2019>s book, if not their prosaic lyrics...Despite some obvious vocal difficulties, Close once again gives a fully invested, psychologically revealing performance...Michael Xavier has a strapping presence and a pleasing rock tenor voice, but he gives a shallow performance that downplays Gillis<U+2019> self-loathing.",""
"16","20","New York Magazine / Vulture","Jesse Green","February 9th, 2017","A train wreck of a revival starring a woeful Close...At every opportunity Hampton and Black take material that kept its balance at the edge of camp and shoves its way over the line...The current revival, in attempting to emphasize the show<U+2019>s musical strengths, only exposes the nonmusical elements to further criticism...It pains me to say that Close's second outing as Norma is no triumph...Her new interpretation of Norma<U+2014>a mite more playful and less otherworldly<U+2014>actually makes things worse.",""
"17","75","New York Daily News","Joe Dziemianowicz","February 9th, 2017","If a few vocals are strained, Close commands the stage in this concert production from the English National Opera. That goes double during 'As If We Never Said Goodbye'...The song is beautiful. The visual is stirring. The 40-piece on-stage orchestra soars, as does Close. The moment is as good as musical theater gets. Otherwise the musical is a mixed bag with choppy tonal shifts. Director Lonny Price can<U+2019>t fix that. But he has assembled a fine cast.",""
"18","80","Deadline","Jeremy Gerard","February 9th, 2017","Close brings an added vulnerability that would be maudlin if it weren<U+2019>t so fragile-seeming...This company is spectacularly well cast...There are a couple of good songs and one great number in the show...The book and lyrics by Christopher Hampton and Don Black pay homage to the film<U+2019>s celebrated lines and have their smart-ish moments. There are some deeply silly passages...Still, the show holds together and Close is every ounce the star she is playing.",""
"19","95","Theater In The Now","Michael Block","February 21st, 2017","The staging by Lonny Price is sensational...Price and his team insured that the brilliant orchestra was a centerpiece of this production...Close gives a master class in performance as the maddened fading star. Mystifying is an understatement...It's easy to get lost with everything that this production brings but Michael Xavier was an incredible leading man...Between Glenn Close and the breathtaking orchestra, you'll never want to say goodbye to this perfect production.",""
"20","80","Front Row Center","Stanford Friedman","February 16th, 2017","Glenn Close is this generation<U+2019>s Shirley Jones...She has mastered the art of bringing controlled madness to her method. Of all the big names attached to this production, the most important is Billy Wilder. The 1950 film which he co-wrote and directed is so chock full of bullet-proof source material, it is impossible not to be entertained by any decent adaptation...Mr. Johanson is fabulous as Max, with his deep voice miraculously ranging into falsetto territory.",""
"21","80","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","February 17th, 2017","<U+201C>Glenn Close is better than ever<U+2026>This revival may be more Encores style concert than the ornately staged original, but it's big in all the right ways<U+2026>This is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best and richest score. Instead of one much reprised ear-clinger, he's written several show-stoppers<U+2026>All this is not to say that Close's Norma, though touchingly vulnerable and doesn't make for a story that's overly melodramatic, incredible and old-fashioned.",""
"22","70","Chicago Tribune","Chris Jones","February 9th, 2017","You could argue that 'Sunset' is a commentary on women in Hollywood <U+2014> but Hampton and Lloyd Webber never really followed Wilder there. And Price is not about to take that on here either, any more than he is about to cast anybody who might pull too much focus from the star...What makes this performance work is Close's palpable vulnerability...It's a very tart and terrifying performance at the core of one of the more lush, sentimental and absurd musicals of the 20th century.",""
"23","75","Newsday","Linda Winer","February 9th, 2017","There is something fitting, even satisfying about this less elaborate, modest incarnation...Close is just as daring but less campy and even more touching as the aging movie queen...Almost as important is the casting of Xavier, the first Joe I<U+2019>ve seen to capture William Holden<U+2019>s attractive, increasingly corrupted nonchalance of Norma<U+2019>s boy toy...The show is a limited edition selling paste and glitter as treasures.

"24","30","The Wrap","Robert Hofler","February 9th, 2017","Close gives a bravura performance: funny, over-the-top, ridiculous.

"25","75","NorthJersey.com","Robert Feldberg","February 10th, 2017","There are a few times when Close skirts the edge of parody...But, taken as a whole, it<U+2019>s an assured, commanding performance by an actress who knows how to deliver the theatrical goods...A dynamic, imaginatively rethought presentation by director Lonny Price...The show<U+2019>s main problem, although not a disqualifying one, is the pedestrian book...However, Close<U+2019>s panache and Lloyd Webber<U+2019>s music are more than enough to carry the evening.",""

Although Ms. Close is the antithesis of Ms. Desmond, the denial and desperation comes through without unintended humor.

I was nervous that I'd keep picturing Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond and William Holden as Joe Gillis, but from the opening  Golden Hollywood  montage, I was hooked. I'm a pre-1960s-cinephile and this musical is so masterfully indulgent that I didn't want it to end. While some of the music felt lackluster at times, there were extremely poignant moments that more than compensated. Close doesn't have the typical  Broadway voice,  but a few cracks and vulnerable moments make for a convincing Norma. Michael Xavier held his own and is one to watch.

The story, of course, is fascinating and Close is matched by the excellent Michael Xavier making his Broadway debut. He was the real discovery to me. Ms. Close's voice is not what it used to be but she acts it out of the park, so it doesn't seem the audience cared she didn't hit some notes (the night I saw it). It's an event, so you may want to catch it - especially if you don't know the show or have never seen Close.

If you're expecting someone with Kelli O'Hara's pipes, you're going to be disappointed--if you pay attention to the performance, Ms. Close's singing, and especially her extraordinary acting fits this role far better than someone with a more beautiful voice. I didn't miss the elaborate sets of 1995 at all, and in fact, I believe the minimalist sets added to the storytelling, where the original production detracted from it. This production would be worth seeing for the 41 piece onstage orchestra playing this sumptuous score. But more importantly, it's worth seeing because it's superb theatre.

It is at the Broadway Theater. 47th & 7th Ave. Just thought everyone should have correct info....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="

You love Glenn Close. You want to see the staging of an iconic movie.","Don't see it if You don't like any of the above. You're not interested in seeing the dark underbelly of Tinseltown depicted in song.=Also I'm basing my review on having seen the show years ago in Los Angeles - also starring Ms. Close as Norma Desmond - who was superb, and assuming that the revival - with her back in the lead - will be just as good. It is a dark, but fascinating story of the side of movie making that you don't see - the failures as opposed to the triumphs, the darkness rather than the light - the has beens rather than the stars. As only Billy Wilder could tell it (and the rest of Hollywood was none too pleased with him when he did). Set to music with the estimable Glenn Close in the lead - it is worth it only for her - and yet there is so much more to the story. Not typical musical material - but well told. I'm posting this now for those of you to put it on their list and get tickets before it's too late. And I have every intention of seeing it again....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="
