"1","95","The New York Times","Charles Isherwood","December 4th, 2016","The marvelous young actor Ben Platt is giving a performance that<U+2019>s not likely to be bettered on Broadway this season. What<U+2019>s more, this gorgeous heartbreaker of a musical has grown in emotional potency during its journey to the big leagues...The musical finds endless nuances in the relationships among its characters...Under the superb direction of the veteran Michael Greif, the show has been subtly refined, its brasher comedy softened, and the performances have grown in delicacy.",""
"2","90","Variety","Marilyn Stasio","December 4th, 2016","Not since 'Next to Normal' has a score tapped so deeply into the troubled psyche of its needy protagonist...The lyrics go beyond the spoken thought and reach for the unspoken feelings hiding behind the words. Better yet, there<U+2019>s not a hint of sentimentality...Under the thoughtful direction of Greif, Platt goes beyond physical specificity to get under Evan<U+2019>s skin and into his unsettled mind.  And the introspective, gentle score becomes the language of his troubled thoughts and yearnings.",""
"3","100","Time Out New York","Adam Feldman","December 4th, 2016","Platt is giving one of the greatest leading male performances I<U+2019>ve ever seen in a musical, and the thrillingly modern and moving 'Dear Evan Hansen' is worthy of it...The musical benefits mightily from Greif<U+2019>s dynamic direction, Korins<U+2019>s vivid set design, Nigrini's cascading projections and an excellent cast...Benj Pasek and Justin Paul<U+2019>s score brims with tuneful and thoughtful songs...And Levenson<U+2019>s book is unfailingly smart...'Dear Evan Hansen' must be seen to be believed.",""
"4","95","Theatermania","Hayley Levitt","December 4th, 2016","Ben Platt is stripped down to his emotional skivvies for us voyeurs to judge, gawk at, and pity. His breathtaking performance in the show's title role is just one of the reasons Pasek, Paul, and Levenson's new musical moves audiences to their feet before the lights even come down...This musical offers a truly 21st-century story...The composers strike a balance between substance and popular appeal with memorable melodies and character-driven lyrics.",""
"5","90","Lighting & Sound America","David Barbour","December 16th, 2016","The whole sorry story is treated by the authors with a remarkable double vision, keeping us engaged with Evan as he careens ever closer to disaster...The songs similarly combine real feeling with sharp-eyed observation as they briskly move the story along...Greif's staging is both well-paced and nuanced, never losing sight of the heartbreak at the story's center; he has also assembled a cast of performers who wear their characters like old clothes.",""
"6","100","The Huffington Post","Steven Suskin","December 4th, 2016","One of the strongest scores in years. The songs are not merely tuneful and funny and touching; Pasek and Paul can plumb the inner depths of their characters and rip through emotions in words and music...Levenson has given us an impressive book which tackles a difficult subject with warmth and humor...Platt is altogether extraordinary...The actors around him are universally excellent...The show continues the progression of astonishing musicals on Broadway.",""
"7","90","DC Theatre Scene","Jonathan Mandell","December 4th, 2016","'Dear Evan Hansen' has changed now that it<U+2019>s on Broadway, in ways that make it an even more affecting musical. Ben Platt<U+2019>s performance, impressive from the get-go, is even better...The transfer feels seamless. The unchanged score holds up, comprised of the same tuneful and moving songs...All give superb performances. Platt has toned down his nervousness <U+2013> he fidgets less <U+2013> which makes his performance all the more credible, all the more heartbreaking.",""
"8","70","Talkin' Broadway","Matthew Murray","December 4th, 2016","If I'm not quite prepared to say that Platt is giving the best performance I've ever seen a male actor give in a musical, it's darn close<U+2014>undoubtedly in the top five. Alas, too much of the rest of 'Evan Hansen' fails to ascend to Platt's exalted level...Fancy staging can't easily conjure electricity from no component materials, and, compelling though Levenson's writing may be, it cries out for a charge Pasek and Paul simply do not provide...Platt, though, provides all he can and then some.",""
"9","80","The Clyde Fitch Report","David Finkle","December 5th, 2016","It<U+2019>s a shame that a late and sizable script shortcoming lowers the rank of this tuner from surpassing musical treat to compromised excellence...The fair approach is to rave about 'Dear Evan Hansen<U+2018>s' outstanding elements, starting with Platt<U+2019>s star-making performance. Surely, too, the place to start is with Levenson<U+2019>s original book...Bolstered by Pasek and Paul<U+2019>s energetic music...They all lack the courage of their dramatic convictions, and thus contrive for Evan an unearned redemption.",""
"10","90","The Wall Street Journal","Terry Teachout","December 5th, 2016","It<U+2019>s smartly crafted, emotionally open-hearted and ideally cast. What<U+2019>s more, it<U+2019>s pitched to and has been embraced by millennials...yet its appeal is universal...Michael Greif has staged 'Dear Evan Hansen' with fluid, fast-moving simplicity...The score is not quite as strong as Steven Levenson<U+2019>s ingenious book...Still, the songs work on their own terms, and the book is strong enough that it could be done on its own as a play...The best musical to open on Broadway since 'Hamilton.'",""
"11","95","AM New York","Matt Windman","December 4th, 2016","A smart, deeply felt and altogether extraordinary new musical...Pasek and Paul have crafted a haunting soft rock score that is neatly integrated into Levenson<U+2019>s captivating book. Greif presents a tight and compelling production built around finely-textured ensemble acting and a seamless visual design of shifting panels and floating video imagery. Platt is giving one of the most vulnerable and shaded performances you<U+2019>ve ever seen.",""
"12","95","The Hollywood Reporter","David Rooney","December 4th, 2016","What's perhaps most distinctive about Pasek and Paul's melodic emo-pop score is how beautifully it captures the peaks and valleys of adolescence, in the thoughtful lyrics and in the music itself...Playwright Steven Levenson matches the musical components beat for beat in his terrific book, which sets up with persuasive conviction what could easily have been a contrived premise...Across the board, the ensemble is superb, each of them registering rich moments of emotional complexity.",""
"13","95","New York Magazine / Vulture","Jesse Green","December 4th, 2016","So fine in its craft and rich in its gathering of themes that it rewards being seen again<U+2014>and again...Platt imbues the character with so much pathos and lively detail that he succeeds as the story<U+2019>s engine despite being almost pathologically passive...That Levenson has been able to find spots for humor at all in this grippingly sad story, and that Pasek and Paul have been able to turn those opportunities into songs of comic relief is a sign of the size of the ideas in play.",""
"14","95","New York Daily News","Joe Dziemianowicz","December 4th, 2016","Platt nails each shifting mood and tone as a socially inept outcast. Original and up-to-the-minute, the musical has a lot to say<U+2014>about parents and children, social media, and more...Stirring ballads and rousing group songs in the vibrant, varied score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul ooze emotions. Director Michael Greif excels at guiding actors through complex stories<U+2014>and his work has never been better...The show's so satisfying it deserves a thank-you note.",""
"15","100","Times Square Chronicles","Suzanna Bowling","December 4th, 2016","With its near perfect score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul...Subtle direction by Michael Grief, combined with a layered and truthful book by Steven Levenson, it has Tony Awards written all over it. Add to that the winning performances by the cast, especially Ben Platt, this musical will get under your skin and speak to you in so many ways...Here is an original musical that didn<U+2019>t skip any steps, wraps its audience in its arms and allows the music, the story and the characters to do their jobs.",""
"16","90","Deadline","Jeremy Gerard","December 4th, 2016","The score by Pasek and Paul is packed with engaging tunes and insightful lyrics. The book by Levenson portrays teen angst taken beyond the normal boundaries with compelling dignity...Platt plays the title role in a movingly sensitive, career-making performance...Platt seems more to inhabit Evan than to merely portray him...The score soars, bringing us along with it. 'Dear Evan Hansen' is an intimate show with a gigantic heart.",""
"17","85","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","December 5th, 2016","With its original team back for the move, it's settled very nicely into the Music Box. The staging has been expanded to fit the larger stage and theater, happily without succumbing to the over amplification, an all-too-common feature of big Broadway musicals. Ben Platt, who was such a terrific Evan last spring, is even better...The rest of the cast is again excellent...Given all of the above, everything I said when I reviewed the show last May still holds.",""
"18","90","Chicago Tribune","Chris Jones","December 4th, 2016","Platt's performance...is as profound and heartbreaking a portrayal of a 17-year-old as one might ever hope to see. It is the heart of a superbly crafted and performed show that is unafraid of complexity and ambiguity...This plot, which rarely strains credulity, brings up a veritable plethora of people in pain, and Pasek and Paul have penned a banquet of ballads of anguish and confusion, but they somehow avoid sentimental exploitation.",""
"19","90","Newsday","Linda Winer","December 4th, 2016","The show is superb<U+2014>original, sensitive, provocative, endearing<U+2014>about so many other knowing and loving things that it<U+2019>s even possible to overlook the unearned happy ending...Everyone is a fully developed person in Levenson<U+2019>s smart book, and the clever, sympathetic songs by Pasek and Paul have a pop intimacy that challenges expansive vocal ranges without seeming to show off. The production by director Greif brings out the real-life depth in the eight exhilarating actors.",""
"20","55","NorthJersey.com","Robert Feldberg","December 5th, 2016","The script ultimately backs off the issues it raises in the service of a happy ending...The evening is seldom lifted by the songs, which, with several notable exceptions, tend to a bland sameness, especially lyrically. And the direction, by Michael Greif, seems at times wrongheaded, better suited to a bigger story...When 'Dear Evan Hansen' is involving, as it certainly is at times, the great share of the credit goes to Platt and his prize-worthy performance.",""
"21","90","Front Mezz Junkies","Steven Ross","December 4th, 2016","'Dear Evan Hansen' has not lost any of its power and tension. It soars with an intense beauty that still captures our hearts and plays havoc with it all at the same time...Not much has changed with 'Dear Evan Hansen' beyond a tightening of its components. Visually it<U+2019>s as perfect and awe-inspiring as it was  -Broadway. Maybe even more so...I<U+2019>m not sure if I will ever feel completely content with the final moments, but all in all, 'Dear Evan Hansen' delivers us a deeply felt rich story.",""
"22","90","CitiTour","Brian Scott Lipton","December 4th, 2016","Heart-stirring and often shattering. But it<U+2019>s not just the show<U+2019>s universal and topical subject matter, smarty explored by Steven Levenson<U+2019>s mostly well-written book or Benj Pasek and Justin Paul<U+2019>s lovely, deeply felt score, that lends the work such pathos. What makes 'Evan Hansen' so special, and oddly lovable, is the brave and extraordinarily raw performance by Ben Platt...In the end, 'Dear Evan Hansen' is both a must-see musical and a tribute to the singular talents of its rising star.",""
"23","90","Wolf Entertainment Guide","William Wolf","December 18th, 2016","A major musical on Broadway that deserves to find a new audience...The entire show is marked by creativity both in staging and performance. Platt is outstanding throughout in the title role of the production, which has a clever book by Levenson and involving music and lyrics by Pasek and Paul...Grief has directed with expert meshing of the show<U+2019>s many ingredients...Not only an enjoyable show, but an admirable one that bears repeat viewing to absorb all of its energy and imagination.",""
"24","95","NY1","Roma Torre","December 5th, 2016","Deeply universal and utterly compelling...It's told utilizing the language of social-media, which director Michael Grief has employed to stunning effect. Pasek and Paul's score, so seamlessly woven into the story line, captures character nuances with the emotional eloquence of our finest dramatic plays, inducing tears and laughter in equal measure. And it is performed by a superlative cast...Platt gives an incomparable performance that ranks among the finest in years.",""

This is a powerful story of a young, high-school misfit played by the remarkable Ben Platt, whose physical and emotionally nuanced performance is so compelling and sensitive that one is in awe...Michael Greif helms the cast with a magical directorial hand...Many Tony nominations and expected awards for this one!!",""

I went into the show knowing nothing about Ben Platt, who plays the eponymous figure, and left with total admiration for him (and his fellow actors). The play had a familiarity to it--a bit reminiscent of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time + Fun Home + Kingdom Come (the latter being a recent off-Broadway work)--but I think most of the familiarity comes from the feeling that we are all, in some way, Evan Hansen. I felt emotional during the last half of the show, and I could hear people behind me blubbering and blowing their noses. Platt gives his all, at one point singing through tears and a runny-nose/snot, which doesn't damper the spirit of the musical at all. Some of the songs are stronger than others, but it's been a while since I've had the pleasure of witnessing a new work on Broadway that has so much heart.

I reacted very strongly to how Evan felt as a child of divorce, and my friend related so strongly to his mom as a mother who often had to work very long hours to help provide for her son. I was lucky enough to talk to Rachel Bay Jones after the show at the stage door and tell her how much I loved her performance and how it made me appreciate everything my mom has done for me even more. She was very sweet and gracious and is a very deserving Tony nominee.Side note: at the time I am writing this review (May 5), someone has edited the show's Wikipedia page to show Ben Platt as the winner of the Tony for Best Actor in a Musical.

In other words, it seemed too easy for Evan to confess and for the Murphys to believe him this far along in the process of redefining Connor's life. Evan's lie has gotten away from him, beyond his control. Who now could make the Murphys believe that Evan wrote the letter  I think only Evan's mother and psychiatrist. The Murphys are now invested in the myth of Connor, which has become much easier for them to accept than the reality expressed in Evan's letter, which ironically enough, applied not just to Evan but also to Connor.

This is serious stuff done intelligently and seriously.=Also DEAR EVAN HANSEN has the best book written for the musical stage since GREY GARDENS, I'd say (maybe FUN HOME can be thrown in there, too) and it's interesting that both shows deal with mental illness. And both have really well-drawn, long-ish book scenes-- not sketches of scenes. But that's besides the point. DEAR EVAN HANSEN is a serious, gut-wrenching look at a young man with social anxiety (maybe mild autism) and his relationship to a situation that grows out of control, and very much by his doing. It has plenty of humor, and one does leave the theatre feeling something deeply (after plenty of tears), but it doesn't sugarcoat pertinent issues like some  issue  musicals have done in the past. That doesn't mean it's not entertaining, or that it's agitprop or  message-y.  It's a show I'd recommend to most people-- especially anyone who has been or has been a parent to a teenager.

It's not perfect but I was invested from start to finish. The book writing is really smart and the acting is stellar, particularly Ben Platt who gives a fully realized character who is equally lovable, pathetic, hilarious, tragic and redeemable. This show breaks the rule that self pitying lead characters don't work in a musical, because although Evan sings about stepping  out of the sun  the subtext is that he desperately longs to be seen and to be loved. Ben Platt's performance is so winning that we want Evan to get what he's longing for even if he has to tell a terrible lie to gain it. My only criticism is that whenever Evan sings his character changes from awkward nerd boy to a confident poet. I wish the writers had worked harder at giving Evan one unified voice. And I was often surprised how Evan's mother reacted later in the play. For a mother who desperately wants her son to be more social she got awfully upset when he started making improvements....<U+00A0>Read more Read less"

The mantra of 'you will be found' does nothing for me - yes, I already know I'm not alone, but what else Evan's character comes off as incredibly self-centered - and no, his anxiety is no excuse for this. Connor is the one who commits suicide, but we never hear about his struggles; rather, it's all about how Evan feels, how it affects Evan, etc. Honestly  I didn't care. I didn't care about a guy growing through somebody else's pain.The show utilizes awful, outdated cliches, including 'the liar revealed' and 'my parents are always busy at work and are never there for me'. In this case, the latter is especially terrible - Heidi Hansen is not trying to avoid her son. They've got financial issues! She's trying to make ends meet! It's not her fault her husband left her!

David Korins' set attempts to swallow us in the vastness of comment culture, but because it stays encapsulated on stage, we still feel distanced from its effects. Director Michael Greif has gotten such an excellent performance out of Ben Platt he seems to have forgotten there were seven other cast members to direct. Given the combined credits of the ensemble, their performances should not have been so over-matched by Platt's, but Greif seems to have focused all his attention on one character. Without revealing any spoilers, to see a lead character travel through such a tangled web of confusion, angst, lies, and pain and ultimately come out without facing the consequences of their actions cheapens the story and sacrifice made by ensemble characters.This was sadly another standing ovation through which I stayed seated....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="
