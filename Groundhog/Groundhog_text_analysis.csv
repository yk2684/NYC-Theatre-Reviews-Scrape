I found the initial song and opening moments a bit trite and uninspired, but the show picks up steam quickly and really hits its strides by Act 2. My biggest criticism is that, save a couple of songs, there aren't too many rousing, memorable numbers due to clunky, repetitive, forced, and/or cliched lyrics. As a writer/poet, I am attuned to wording: this may not bother another theatregoer. Moreover, Andy Karl was such a trooper in his leg brace, following his recent injury, and even used the brace as a comedic  prop  of sorts (via some gestures and well-timed lines that landed just-so) and really charmed the audience.

The second act is worthwhile, so if you're a little bored after the first act, it's worth sticking around. There are a few parts that don't add to the show (aspect with homeless man, beginner tap number), and the romance is very forced, but that's similar to the film. Overall an entertaining show with interesting staging choices, great singing voices, and a few spectacular songs.Update: Saw this show again with Andy Karl and it was a much more high energy, fun experience.

West End theater and Broadway are two very different animals with very different audience tastes. This show has trouble right from the get go. The main character, played in the movie by a generations comedy star, is played as an obnoxious weather man by the talented (although a bit cheesy) Andy Karl. There is little to like here.

Broadway loves a  message  and this message is:  Relax, have a good time and, oh yeah, try to do some good.  Andy Karl (Phil Connors) is stupendous. A great voice and great facials makes him a strong focal point that never wears thin. He captures the essence of the Bill Murray portrayal but without the belligerence. Barrett Doss (Rita Hanson) is winsome and engaging, the purity of her character mirroring the small town spirit of Punxsutawney (Home of the legendary, Phil...who is quite a drummer...)

If you're prepared for that, you will enjoy the nice touches throughout and the very clever staging, which is surprisingly low-tech (except for the highly sophisticated turntable, which is used very well.

I'm a little disappointed with the acting because part of what drove the original movie was that Bill Murray was such an asshole. Andy Karl, while very competent, is too sweet and didn't capture the big change from him being a complete self centered jerk to the kind person at the end. It just didn't drive it home enough. The singing was alright, but they seemed hesitant and a little unsure. Maybe they just made changes earlier that day before the show  I do have to give a special shout out to the actress playing Nancy for the beautiful ( but really random!!! ) solo at the beginning of act 2....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="

I don't honestly believe that everyone in this town is that happy.

Instead of getting funnier and funnier as it's repeated, it gets extremely tiresome. Once the second act starts, the book (and Andy Karl) gets very creative (and very funny) whipping Karl into a frenzy as the days rush by. It's a rare musical whose second act is better than its first.However, there are two solos in the act, both gorgeous ballads beautifully sung, that seem to be out of a different, Spoon River Anthology-ish version of the show. It's a too-little, too-late attempt to give the minor roles a broader impact in the narrative, and both slow the raucous momentum to a crawl. They will absolutely be highlights of the original cast album (which, make no mistake, I will pre-order as soon as it's announced) but they seem really out-of-place in the show as it stands.Oh, and the poster is way too dull....<U+00A0>Read more Read less"

Even Rita was too light. - and London's Rita wasn't likable enough to warrant Phil's transition. Thank goodness for Andie MacDowell in the movie.
