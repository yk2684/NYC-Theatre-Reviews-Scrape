"1","80","Theatermania","Zachary Stewart","March 16th, 2017","Director Terry Kinney keeps us constantly pondering the connection between the past and the present in his straightforward production, which allows the playwright's words to come to the fore...Everything is highly realistic, especially the performances...'The Price' only begins to feel draining in its operatic second act...It all could easily become tedious coming from lesser actors, but it never does here. Instead, Hecht, DeVito, Ruffalo, and Shalhoub lead us in an emotional workout.",""

Kinney directs a superlative cast consisting of Ruffalo, Shalhoub, Hecht, and DeVito, who make this revival a treasured experience...Under Kinney<U+2019>s measured direction, the recriminations really heat up in the galvanic second act, when kind Esther and adorable Solomon fade into the shadows and let the brothers fight their old quarrels until one or both of them falls over.",""

Only when he<U+2019>s onstage does 'The Price' seem right.",""

"5","25","New Yorker","Hilton Als","March 16th, 2017","Kinney doesn<U+2019>t so much direct here as organize traffic, and most of the show takes place in a bottleneck: one watches listlessly because the script doesn<U+2019>t seem to matter much to the actors, or, when it does, they<U+2019>re using it to their own aims, as in the case of DeVito. Ruffalo is dead on his feet, and Hecht, ever needy, feels entirely lost. It<U+2019>s as if she and Shalhoub, whose insinuating sexiness fails him in this role, are waiting for the show to be over.",""

In no other work of his are the battle lines so fairly drawn, the conflict so well-armed on both sides.",""

If none are at their absolute best here, that only means that all of them at one time or another have given performances that have left me in awe...The play also feels dated...People of any era should be able to respond to the themes, but the particulars, at least in this production, make it feel too distant to strike home with full force.",""
"9","60","Front Row Center","Tulis McCall","March 24th, 2017","DeVito is determined and brilliant. This is a performance that crackles. In comparison to him, all the other actors seem like they are once removed, as if they were under water. It is a startling contrast...Hard to say if it is the writing or the performances, but everyone felt out of sorts...For this writer it was uneventful bordering on confusing<U+2013>this is the part where the actors felt out of sync and the blocking was awkward.",""

Four powerhouse performances, with DeVito really shining with comic flair and timing. The question is a simple one. What is the price of the decisions we make  For Victor Franz (Ruffalo), his decision to help his father cope with bankruptcy during The Great Crash of 1929 has trapped him in a go-nowhere job despite a brilliant childhood.

This is all wrapped by Soloman's offer to buy the father's furniture which has been in storage for years. The Price joins A View from the Bridge and The Crucible as recent Arthur Miller revivals proving that as a playwright, Miller endures. This production is a star-studded line up that does not disappoint....<U+00A0>Read more Read less="

As a result, it felt like Tony Shalhoub and Mark Ruffalo were trying to manufacture moments to raise the stakes. And it was so hard to understand Mark. He was very quiet, and he mumbled a lot of the time. Danny DeVito was the only actor who stood out for me. He was funny, and right on the money.
