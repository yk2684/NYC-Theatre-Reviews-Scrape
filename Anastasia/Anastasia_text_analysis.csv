The postcard-scenic show that bears her name has its own troubling case of multiple personality disorder...The show in which she appears trembles nonstop with internal conflicts during its drawn-out two-and-a-half hours...The cartoon version from 1997 is very fondly remembered by people who saw it as tweens...Those without such nostalgic insulation are likely to find this 'Anastasia' a chore.",""

"6","70","DC Theatre Scene","Jonathan Mandell","April 24th, 2017","'Anastasia' winds up promoting nostalgia for the last reign of the Romanovs, those elegantly attired autocrats who sponsored pogroms against the Jews...If the songs don<U+2019>t offer the same power or allure as their scores for 'Ragtime,' they are a clever and melodic enough accompaniment for what is the real strength of this production<U+2013>its beautiful design and its wonderful cast...How the plot plays out will surprise no one, but there are some palpable delights along the way.",""

"9","65","Talkin' Broadway","Matthew Murray","April 24th, 2017","For all these smart changes, this 'Anastasia' fails to completely escape the influence of its cartoony forebear...Everything is technically proficient. It's just also too vanilla to linger long in your mind, or at all in your heart. At least Tresnjak's staging is slick, handsome, and fast-moving...To do justice to Anastasia's story, there must be genuine risks, genuine losses, and genuine feelings that go beyond surface-level, cookie-cutter emotions and their matching songs.",""

Christy Altomare is smashing as Anya, with powerhouse vocals full of spark and sensitive yearning.",""
"11","70","The Hollywood Reporter","David Rooney","April 24th, 2017","The show as a whole is a tad bland, though it<U+2019>s beautifully staged...There's a workmanlike feel to the musical's construction. Lack of nuance in the writing makes the three leads, while vocally strong, quite vanilla...But Tresnjak elevates the material...It's kitschy, old-fashioned entertainment given a relatively sophisticated presentation, and you have to acknowledge its success when you hear the target demographic swoon on cue.",""

McNally<U+2019>s book, its structural improvements notwithstanding, is similarly bland...Tresnjak<U+2019>s tonally schizophrenic staging only makes things worse...It bewilders me that in making stage musicals from animated movies, adapters seem to think they can remain outside history.",""

With her pure singing voice, appealing stage presence and strong acting choices, Altomare has that illusive 'it factor' that makes you care about her...This score is tuneful and scrumptious...It also helps when you have incredibly powerful vocals from Altomare, Karimloo and Klena.

"17","45","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","April 30th, 2017","If this sounds more calculated for a long, multiple ticket-selling life than genuinely heart-touching, you're right. In fairness, Altomare is a fine Anya. Though she lacks real superstar charisma, she has a lovely soprano...The most successful aspect of this production comes from the knockout production values...But while I love the way sophisticated stagecraft can enhance a show, scenery is intended to support the story and performers, rather than be the scene-stealing star.",""
"18","70","Chicago Tribune","Chris Jones","April 24th, 2017","Works quite delightfully when the star is center stage, and struggles mightily when she is off in the wings, where the charming Christy Altomare spends far too long...A clunky start...Tresnjak forges some potent later scenes...This is not a musical that wants to start a revolution. To say the least. But once McNally's book finds its feet, and the physical production gets out of the way of the several gorgeous, old-school ballads therein, 'Anastasia' has its moments of credible emancipation.",""
"19","60","Newsday","Linda Winer","April 24th, 2017","More power ballads have been added to the pretty but dispiritingly predictable story of Anastasia...Tony-winning director Darko Tresnjak keeps everything moving attractively along. But there is little he can do with a vapid story that has absolutely no context for a revolution that, in this version of history, only turns out paupers and bureaucratic puppets...Christy Altomare is strong as Anya.",""

The singing is gorgeous.","Don't see it if you dislike a  cutesy  show, romantic interludes, or don't like to be left without total closure. This is a lovely musical to simply enjoy.=Also Anastasia is one of those Broadway musicals that will likely delight the same audiences who enjoy Disney (and similar)-related stories, or timeless pieces like The Phantom of the Opera. It has an identifiable romantic feel, amplified by the marvelous sets, light-displays on the wall of the theatre, and rather dreamy quality to it. Between the Russian and Parisian moments of the play, there is plenty to keep your eyes busy; the talented cast keeps your ears attentive with their wonderful singing; and there are some lovely dancing moments as well. Rooted in a semi-real story, Anastasia definitely awakens the history-buff in me. Although the  real Anastasia  remains a mystery, there is enough real detail here to really make you think about how the world can be so cruel. There are darker, blood-red moments here. But glimpses of harsh reality make the fluffier, decadent moments feel more necessary than camp. I'm not much of a love-story person, but this musical offers something for all....<U+00A0>Read more Read less"

No melody (except for movie's  Once Upon A December ) is really moving or emotionally engaging.The plot has so little tension that any resolution comes almost unnoticed. The  villain  creates no suspense in the story. His  investigation  is unknown to the main characters (who suffer no fear nor tension from it) and his resolution is so inconsequential (and historically absurd) that it becomes as boring and needless as his ballads. That role should have been scraped before it got to NY. Karimloo is awkwardly miscast. His voice in no way harmonizes with the other actors' whose voices do create a unified musical whole.

The set, which includes projections, was absolutely jaw-dropping, and the costumes were so exquisite I couldn't take my eyes from them. The leads are all wonderful, but the real treat were John Bolton and Caroline O'Connor. Bolton never fails to deliver much more than one can reasonably expect, and O'Connor, while new to me, I'm looking forward to seeing again in other shows.If you have children, especially girls, who've outgrown Lion King, this show is perfect for them.
