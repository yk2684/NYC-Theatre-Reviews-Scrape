"19","60","Financial Times (UK)","Max McGuinness","May 23rd, 2016","Mitchell<U+2019>s version cleverly evokes the 'satanic mills' of industrialisation and the lonely romance of the railroads, but it<U+2019>s not quite enough to pad out the story for two hours. As directed and co-developed by Rachel Chavkin, 'Hadestown' thus feels more like a semi-staged concert (albeit an entertaining one) than a fully developed work of musical theatre.
