"2","75","Theatermania","Zachary Stewart","January 12th, 2014","Director Marc Bruni has taken the gift of a smart and economical script and run with it. Amid lightning-quick transitions, this show only decelerates when it wants to. Split-second costume changes (designer Alejo Vietti must be a witch) add to the magic and fun of the evening.",""
"3","65","Variety","Marilyn Stasio","January 12th, 2014","The early life and career of legendary singer-songwriter Carole King surely deserves more imaginative treatment than the corny chronological storytelling and old-fashioned musical format of <U+201C>Beautiful.<U+201D>  But all is forgiven, whenever Jessie Mueller, in the modest person of Carole King, sits down at the piano and pours heart and soul into familiar favorites from the composer<U+2019>s songbook.",""

In other words, it should have a long and healthy run, if, the producers can either convince Jessie Mueller to remain in the title role forever or if they can find replacements as enormously talented as she is.",""

The book is crucial, too <U+2014> and this show<U+2019>s connect-the-dots story line is so simplistic that the extravagantly talented King<U+2019>s life emerges as a mundane version of the long-suffering little woman.",""

All of the necessary elements have come together here, from a surprisingly smart and witty book by Douglas McGrath, smooth direction by Marc Bruni, and the work of a consistently top-notch cast.

"12","80","Theatre is Easy","Adrienne Urbanski","January 19th, 2014","'Beautiful' places more focus on the music than the story and plot, making it not so much a tribute to Carole King<U+2019>s life as it is a tribute to her large body of work...King<U+2019>s relationship with Gerry is glossed over and we learn little about what their life is like. This leads to the end of their relationship feeling less dramatic and climactic than it could have been...Anyone who was not a fan of King<U+2019>s songs before the show will most likely be one by curtain call.",""
"13","70","Broadway Blog","Matthew Wexler","January 21st, 2014","Director Marc Bruni and the design team keep things moving at a brisk pace. The show is tightly directed and seamlessly flows from the songwriters to the pop artists that shared their work with the world.

"14","60","StageZine","Scott Harrah","January 16th, 2014","'Beautiful' lacks the biographical wallop and dramatic intensity of such jukebox musicals as 'Jersey Boys' and the gleeful fun of 'Mamma Mia'... The presentation and performances of these venerable songs is hollow and spotty, like watching a highbrow version of TV<U+2019>s 'Solid Gold'<U+2026>Regardless, 'Beautiful' has a guilty-pleasure sense of fun and nostalgia and a few hearty performances, making us overlook the show<U+2019>s many shortcomings.",""

ALSO, since the house is one of the newest on Broadway, the view lines from basically everywhere in the house are perfect! The cheap seats in the back of the mezzanine are some of the best seats.
