So many people leaned forward, that it was impossible not to. The front lip of the stage is hard to see at that angle, and while you'll be able to see the faces there, the dancing is not so well viewed. Moreover, if you're looking for some brand new and shiny take on this show, it's not that. This is very much a replica of the best versions of Dolly, including the film. It's clear they spent a lot of money on the sets, the train and the restaurant being particularly special.

The sets, the costumes, the lighting - all gorgeous; the talent - astounding; the direction - spot on. This is a production in which a beloved classic is brought to stunning new life, expertly crafted and vivaciously performed. The timbre of every moment resonates beautifully. Bette Midler is of course the major draw, but I would see it without her again and again because it's a rare thing to see an old gem polished up and displayed so exquisitely....<U+00A0>Read more Read less"
