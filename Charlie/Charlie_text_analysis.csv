"1","55","The New York Times","Ben Brantley","April 23rd, 2017","This big but tentative show doesn<U+2019>t burst with flavor of any kind, not during its exposition-crammed first act. Only in its second half does the show acquire a distinct taste and it isn<U+2019>t confectionary...The idea of macabre punishment seems to have acted as a stimulant on the creative faculties of everyone involved as the show turns increasingly surreal...Most gratifying is the transformation of Borle...Willy switches into dissing diva mode with a skip in his step and a fork in his tongue.","="
"2","45","Theatermania","Zachary Stewart","April 23rd, 2017","Incorporating songs from the film, it seems to present itself as earnest entertainment for children and nostalgic adults. Grieg's caustic book and Shaiman and Wittman's pastiche score, on the other hand, feels like a beast with much sharper talons...The show gets considerably better in the second act, when it becomes the Christian Borle show. He exudes a manic genius that fits the eccentric candy industrialist...He can't save everything though...A musical that doesn't know what it wants to be.","="
"3","35","Time Out New York","David Cote","April 23rd, 2017","Joyless, shapeless and grating...a stale Necco wafer of a musical...O<U+2019>Brien directs this dull, clunky adaptation of the book and movie with none of the wit of the former nor the dreamy wonder of the latter. Maybe kids will enjoy the gaudy design and veneer of sassy satire, but when you bite down, there<U+2019>s only empty shell. Younger audiences can cheer, but adults are bound to conclude that 'Charlie' is like what happens with an Everlasting Gobstopper: lots of sucking.","="

Happily, the character of Charlie Bucket escapes this mishandling...Ryan Foust was the best thing in the show...As played by Borle, Willy Wonka's much too charming and lacks the aura of stranger-danger.","="
"5","60","Lighting & Sound America","David Barbour","May 1st, 2017","If it is hardly the best musical on Broadway, it is surely the most improved...The book suffers from the fact that it takes an entire act to get to the chocolate factory...The second act is, quite possibly, the most macabre children's entertainment ever...If 'Charlie' isn't likely to entertain adults looking for a sophisticated Broadway musical, it is probably just the thing for parents looking to take the kids to a show. They aren't likely to notice its less-than-seamless assembly.","="

"18","20","Chicago Tribune","Chris Jones","April 23rd, 2017","A deeply disappointing musical...You do get flashes of Dahl's brand of caustic fun. For a few seconds. They're gone with the snap of a light cue or a bit of a sugar-free trick...It's emblematic of how a musical with unlimited imaginative potential never fully decided whether this was to be a retro experience or a cultural probing of the moment. Either one could have worked. But not without that moment when a world of sugar unfolds, and a boy's aching heart almost stops.","="

Christian Borle delights!","Don't see it if you dislike zany, quixotic antics and sets; don't want to see children maimed or exploded (semi-explicitly); dislike Roald Dahl's world.=Also I'm not the biggest Roald Dahl fan, but his works have always held a spot in my heart due to nostalgia. I love Gene Wilder's take on Willy Wonka, and even enjoyed the Johnny Depp version nearly as much: I have also always had a special affection for young Charlie Bucket and his family. I went into this new musical, therefore, not wanting to get my hopes up. While Broadway's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory could do with larger sets (and lower prices for their merchandise booth chocolate bars!), I have a feeling that pared-down set design is due to the difficulty in changing sets so often (some look heavy) and not making the show glaringly ostentatious. Adults playing children (minus Charlie) did not distract--they really embodied their roles well. Christian Borle definitely is committed (as always) to making his semi-Gene-Wilder-inspired portrait of the mysterious and iconic candymaker his own. This is not a musical for those who want rich romance and  pretty  sets. Come for fun!...<U+00A0>Read more Read less= 0="

Then, there's Christian Borle who can do no wrong as the maniacal Willy Wonka. John Rubenstein's Grandpa Joe was a delight. The stellar cast breathes life and soul into a staging that may not reflect the best of Broadway, but nevertheless presents the fantastic effects of the Oompa Loompas and the  deaths  of Violet Beauregarde and Veruca Salt.

Charlie's family lived & dressed in a time where few people had electricity, washing machines were rare, and 79 cents was a lot of money. Yet the other kids who won had iPads, smartphones, access to Wifi. It made no sense.Second, the sets were a HUGE disappointment. If ever there was a show to blow your wad on the set budget, it would be this one, and they completely failed.

Not a game-changer, not a huge-name star, but a solid musical that is family-friendly.

Instead it was a small, odd, unimpressive diorama that the actors walked around awkwardly. I felt cheated - I was expecting something jaw-dropping. I'm really puzzled by this choice.One other tiny quibble - they make a big deal about how the character Violet Beauregarde is famous for her bubble gum blowing, but they only show her blowing a bubble once; why is that Supporting cast is really solid - loved the grandparents, and really loved Jackie Hoffman as Mrs. Teavee.

Cut the intermission, make it a quick one act. Short sweet more borle less charlie. That's what this show needs.

The Cabbage lady had the last golden ticket, and in the end had no tie in with Willy Wonka, so this was a big gap. They had a scene that you had to use your imagination, it was interesting, but still a waste of potential. The scene of being under water and not entering the room was just plain waste of time, I feel this was to be the bubble scene, but maybe something went wrong, and they had to cut it, but either way it just didn't work.
