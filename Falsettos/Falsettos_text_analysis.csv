"1","100","The New York Times","Charles Isherwood","October 27th, 2016","There<U+2019>s hardly a moment in the exhilarating, devastating revival of the musical 'Falsettos' that doesn<U+2019>t approach, or even achieve, perfection...Directed by Mr. Lapine<U+2014>whose work is so sharp it<U+2019>s as if he were seeing the show with a new pair of eyes...Mr. Borle shines here as he has never before...'Falsettos' never feels like a singing time capsule. Its fundamental subject is that mysterious, maddening, uplifting, life-complicating emotion we refer to as love, which hasn<U+2019>t changed in 25 years.",""
"2","80","Theatermania","Zachary Stewart","October 27th, 2016","While it is always delightful to hear the composer's idiosyncratic voice onstage, the dramaturgical flaws inherent in the piece don't go unnoticed...The songwriting is the real reason to see this show...The drastic tonal swing of the second act requires an emotional gear shift that not every audience member may be able to make...That disappointing outcome is not for lack of trying on the part of the cast...A near-perfect revival of a decidedly imperfect musical.",""
"3","85","BroadwayWorld","Michael Dale","October 28th, 2016","Lapine serves as director for the terrific new Broadway revival of 'Falsettos' that, through more lyric revisions and interpretations that provide a greater unity of tone, finally fuse the two acts into a singular piece of romance, wit, jaunty melodies and realistic characters trying to keep their neuroses in check...Lapine's new cast takes 'Falsettos' in intriguing new directions.",""
"4","85","Variety","Marilyn Stasio","October 27th, 2016","This surprisingly fresh revival has been directed by original director Lapine, who plainly understands the bittersweet humor and provisional joy of that period...The warm performances of a terrific cast soften the underlying sadness of Finn<U+2019>s breakthrough musical...The story is largely told through the easygoing score, a fusion of tuneful melodies with insightful lyrics...Borle<U+2019>s neurotic hero is well matched with Rannells<U+2019> Whizzer.",""
"5","85","Time Out New York","Adam Feldman","October 27th, 2016","Few musicals have the range, idiosyncrasy and emotional punch of this profoundly unconventional and personal work...As enjoyable as the snaggletoothed and biting first half can be, it hardly prepares you for the extraordinary second...Finn pushes musical theater to the limits of what we can ask of it. Those who know the show may find fault with some of the revival<U+2019>s choices...But flaws are written into 'Falsettos,' as is the impulse it elicits to forgive them.",""
"6","80","The Guardian (UK)","Alexis Soloski","October 27th, 2016","'March' is perhaps the more interesting half...The second act is more conventional...But it<U+2019>s here that the work<U+2019>s emotional heart beats most muscularly and anyone who leaves without shedding a tear may want to see his or her ophthalmologist...The Broadway revival is not a copy of the original...Neither is it a faultless work...Yet Lapine directs in a style that remains both consciously frolicsome and helplessly shrewd.",""
"7","10","New Yorker","Hilton Als","November 7th, 2016","One of the most dishonest musicals I have ever seen...What can you do with a show that opens with a song called 'Four Jews in a Room Bitching,' and uses AIDS to endow it with seriousness  The rot at the center of 'Falsettos' is slathered in self-congratulation. Finn and Lapine use Jews, AIDS, and so on to rope in a particular audience, which is then held captive to their seemingly endless array of self-referential songs and weak humor.",""
"8","90","Lighting & Sound America","David Barbour","November 9th, 2016","'Falsettos' remains a marvel of social observation and humane comedy<U+2014>and the second act packs a knockout punch that very few musicals can match...In number after number, Finn both spoofs and sympathizes with his characters as they stumble around...Lapine has assembled a top-flight cast to get inside the heads of these complex, contradictory, often self-defeating characters...The time has never been riper for a revival of this beautiful show.",""
"9","55","New York Theater","Jonathan Mandell","November 12th, 2016","There is much I enjoyed about it, especially the performances of its exceptional seven-member cast...But ultimately I found 'Falsettos' neither terrible nor terrific...For all its willingness to present ambivalent, bickering characters in complicated relationships, 'Falsettos' feels dated in many ways...The melodies produce no earworms, and the lyrics sometimes spin word pictures with the delicacy of a sledgehammer...There are moments...when I<U+2019>m nothing but glad they brought it back.",""
"10","80","Talkin' Broadway","Matthew Murray","October 27th, 2016","'Falsettos' has cemented its stake for greatness, even for skeptics like me, by proving, with this production, that it has a lot more on its mind and in its heart than just the current political zeitgeist...What struck me this time around was its all-consuming universality...Borle's performance is fully integrated and absolutely seamless, the kind of thing we should see from every Broadway performer all the time, but in actuality rarely do. That includes, sadly, much of what surrounds Borle.",""
"11","85","The Huffington Post","David Finkle","October 27th, 2016","How does 'Falsettos' look nearly 25 years on  Just great<U+2014>with only the merest reservations that certainly don't have anything to do with the several brilliant Finn songs...Today its impact has shifted. It's an unflinching look back. Nevertheless, as it plays, it retains emotional pangs...Last but hardly least in this wholly sincere recommendation are the cast members who understand the Finn and Lapine paean to humanity and bring it movingly to the stage.",""
"12","70","The Wall Street Journal","Terry Teachout","October 27th, 2016","So how does 'Falsettos' hold up...Better than 'The Normal Heart,' but not nearly so well as 'Angels in America'. The first act, 'March of the Falsettos,' remains impressive. Notwithstanding Finn<U+2019>s inability to write once-heard-never-forgotten tunes, the musical numbers are cleverly crafted and the overall tone is appropriately tart...In 'Falsettoland,' by contrast, a hideously painful situation is portrayed with a sincere but cloying sentimentality that occasionally curdles into kitsch.",""
"13","95","AM New York","Matt Windman","October 27th, 2016","Farcical comedy and heartbreaking drama are served in equal measure in the triumphant Broadway revival...The world has changed considerably since 'Falsettos' premiered, but the musical holds up as a poignant exploration of family breaking apart, growing up and coming together...Lapine<U+2019>s production is energetic, finely textured and extremely well-cast...The cast scores vocally, comically and dramatically, bringing out the manic heights and tender pauses of this truly extraordinary musical.",""
"14","95","The Hollywood Reporter","David Rooney","October 27th, 2016","Pretty much everything about Lincoln Center Theater's ideally cast Broadway revival, again directed by Lapine with as much humor as sensitivity, makes it pure pleasure...The characters are so fresh, the writing so emotionally insightful and the situations played with such feeling that 'Falsettos' hasn't aged a day...Part of the show's durability is the generosity of spirit and affection with which the writers approach every last one of their imperfect characters.",""
"15","85","New York Magazine / Vulture","Jesse Green","October 27th, 2016","A heartbreaking revival...It<U+2019>s hard to get through the last half hour intact...If this Lincoln Center Theater production, directed by Lapine, has any serious faults, they arise from that agenda. As written, Marvin is so nasty and erratic in the first act ...Christian Borle can<U+2019>t resolve that contradiction and thus comes off a bit unsteady, at least until he regains his footing in the second act. The other principals, whose roles are more tightly written, are excellent throughout.",""
"16","85","New York Daily News","Joe Dziemianowicz","October 27th, 2016","Life is messy <U+2014> as everybody knows...That includes creators William Finn and James Lapine. They don<U+2019>t sugarcoat reality when it comes to love, sexuality and relationships...That clear-eyed take has always been <U+2014> and still is <U+2014> an intriguing strength of 'Falsettos'...Finn<U+2019>s alternately lighthearted and poignant score in this mostly sung-through show is another major asset...Plan on being deeply touched and richly satisfied at this show.",""
"17","85","Times Square Chronicles","Suzanna Bowling","November 4th, 2016","'Falsettos' shines just as brightly in 2016. It takes the mark of a score that weaves its ways into your soul, a book that knows how to speak with honesty and a director who allows the show to live on its own merits to do that...The one thing that bothered me were the orchestrations and the slowing down of the original tempos...Finn<U+2019>s score sticks to your soul like embedded thorns of wisdom. Lapine<U+2019>s direction takes on a new dimension...If you want to be moved, this is the show to see.",""
"18","75","Deadline","Jeremy Gerard","October 27th, 2016","It<U+2019>s got tons of heart, unimpeachable performances...But while the production left me teary in all the right places, and laughing in all the other right places, it never actually took flight. It<U+2019>s earthbound...What<U+2019>s bafflingly wrong with the production has primarily to do with the visuals...That, combined with a first act that just works too damned hard to win us over, makes for some rough going...But then Act II happens and the show, for all its dark turns, suddenly seems light as air.",""
"19","80","Front Row Center","Kathleen Campion","November 14th, 2016","The production is lively and pointed without a whiff of tired...If the plot verges on predictable, the characters are another story...They are simple<U+2014>as in clear, and accessible, and engaging...All the maneuvering for that love is informed by funny and complicated lyrics and ironically compatible harmonies. Direction is superb...I<U+2019>m glad I saw 'Falsettos' in its current iteration and find it a period piece with enormous vitality.",""
"20","95","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","November 11th, 2016","Finn's sung-through score is lyrical and sophisticated, full of intricate multiple harmonies. The lyrics are an organic blend of heart-tugging emotion and sophistication, and thanks to the small cast and orchestra achieve the clarity of conversations...This beautifully staged and performed revival is one of the most moving, eye and ear pleasing old-new musicals currently on Broadway. James Lapine once again directs gracefully so that 'Falsettos' feels fresh as ever.",""
"21","80","Chicago Tribune","Chris Jones","October 27th, 2016","Some of the individual moments of this Lincoln Center production are fantastic <U+2014> Block, who is so well cast here and doing the best work of her Broadway career, does everything you could ask with the show's great, reflective ballads. You are never entirely convinced that Borle and Rannells are deeply in love...Mostly though, it is an unequivocal pleasure to let Finn's music and lyrics return to your consciousness.",""
"22","85","Newsday","Linda Winer","October 27th, 2016","The show remains brave and hilarious, a charming and deeply moving treasure...That first half feels very sweet but a little naive these days, somewhat of a period piece without all the rich sadness and lyric maturity of what comes later. But then...bam!...Although it<U+2019>s hard to separate these characters from the original actors, the cast is terrific...Lapine<U+2019>s direction is finely calibrated to be showy without being show-bizzy.",""
"23","65","The Wrap","Robert Hofler","October 27th, 2016","It<U+2019>s very unlikely that William Finn will ever get a better production of his groundbreaking musical 'Falsettos'...Top among its assets are leading men Christian Borle and Andrew Rannells...Now for the unfortunate news. If ever Disney made a family movie musical about homosexuals, 'Falsettos' would be the one to start with. This observation is not meant as a compliment. 'Gay' here is gay in the Irving Berlin sense of the word...Finn and Lapine put the 'false' in 'Falsettos.'",""
"24","90","NorthJersey.com","Robert Feldberg","October 28th, 2016","Not your typical Broadway musical, but it's being given a top-shelf Broadway production, with knowing direction, striking scenery and flawless performances from highly talented musical-theater actors...What enables it to work <U+2013> what makes the evening funny and rueful <U+2014> is William Finn's singular score, which goes to the heart of each matter...Directed with great empathy by James Lapine, 'Falsettos' achieves the same power it had a quarter-century ago.",""
"25","75","Front Mezz Junkies","Steven Ross","October 27th, 2016","The music in 'Falsettos' is gorgeous and fun, complex and surprising...I wanted to cheer this whole show on from beginning to end. It<U+2019>s fun and connecting. Beautiful, emotional, and engaging. Painful and sweet. But, there are also moments that feel dated and confusing...This could be one problem with keeping the same director (Lapine) as when it first played on Broadway...A new eye and different vision would have elevated this beautiful show to a higher level.",""

And I do think it's the material, not the production...Though it might have been groundbreaking and important in its time (helping it develop a cult following), this 'Falsettos' revival does not add anything to the conversation now, and there doesn't seem to be any urgency to it, a compelling reason to revisit it.",""

"66","80","Reflections in the Light","Lauren Yarger","November 21st, 2016","The musical makes an unintended statement about what attitudes should have been back then, in what they seem to be today. Finn's music ranges from fun to moving (there were a lot of tears shed at the end of act one) and the lyrics are touching. The characters are all flawed, but honest. And in the end, love wins.

I think this version suffers from the director<U+2019>s overly close relationship to the material. The first act desperately needs a much more active director to establish a protagonist and a clearer narrative arc. The wife comes closest to showing a character in struggle when it should be Marvin. At this point in previews, the first act plays like a review with songs that are loosely related. I was also surprised by the occasional tonal switch to slapstick shtick. The second act, on the other hand, has everything the first act lacks and is highly rewarding.

The singing, especially in the first half ('March of the Falsettos') is not super-strong. I imagine that the original production was cast not on star-power, but on vocal chops. While all of these folks are very good singers, it feels like they are out of their element a bit, trying to fit their vocal ranges and techniques to a score intended for different vocal types. Also, I DID NOT LIKE the lyric changes. They seemed really basic and random, did not do anything to add to character or story... I was especially annoyed at the lyric changes for Cordelia.
