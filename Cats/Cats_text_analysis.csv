Mr. Lloyd Webber is a musical magpie...The cast for the revival is largely excellent.",""
"2","60","Theatermania","Zachary Stewart","July 31st, 2016","Nunn seems to have revisited the material with the attitude, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Despite new choreography and cutting-edge lighting, it still carries a retro vibe...Plot is ancillary to a beautiful fantasy conveyed through music and dance...Still, if you look around and see the remarkable creativity and innovation happening on Broadway these days, it is hard to view this production as anything more than a museum piece.",""
"3","75","BroadwayWorld","Michael Dale","July 31st, 2016","A sweet and endearing revival...While not every role requires triple-threat expertise, 'Cats' makes some serious acting, singing and dancing demands on its company and Nunn's litter is packed with terrific performers...Pop star Leona Lewis has been cast as Grizabella. She has no acting credits in her bio and it shows, making the evening's climactic moment a sad letdown.",""

Rather than lamely re-creating the original, why not orchestrate the score for acoustic instruments, redo the costumes and dances, and find fresh drama underneath the tacky, dated pageantry  Instead we get a taxidermied pet. If there is heart to the piece, it<U+2019>s Grizabella, the faded, outcast 'glamour cat.' British crooner Leona Lewis has a big, yearning voice, but even her (heavily amplified) yowling of 'Memory' can<U+2019>t make the past worth revisiting.<U+201D>",""

Plotless, repetitive, nonsensical, the <U+2019>80s relic quickly turns tiresome enough to make you wish for a catnap.

"16","75","CurtainUp","Elyse Sommer","July 31st, 2016","No doubt the success of the 2014 revival of 'Cats' in London encouraged the producers to bring it back to New York. And wisely, they've done so with a new cast of top to bottom standouts and vital and fresh choreography that retained the feeling of the original. This does indeed boost the show's strong points...The ballet sequences seem especially take-your-breath-way spectacular...'Cats' may not be a great musical, but it's a great visual spectacle expertly performed.",""
"17","65","Newsday","Linda Winer","July 31st, 2016","Unlikely to disappoint...fans...For the resistant rest of us, it remains an overblown kiddie show...Director Trevor Nunn has put together a first-rate cast of singers and dancers, who prowl the aisles and crawl onstage through sewer tunnels with tireless enthusiasm.

"23","25","The Associated Press","Mark Kennedy","July 31st, 2016","It<U+2019>s not been revamped or re-thought, just taken out of mothballs...Andy Blankenbuehler was brought in to bring something more modern to Gillian Lynne<U+2019>s original choreography, which was slinky and jazzy. He has pretty much failed...The theatrical evolutions since 1982 make 'Cats' seem quaint and unsubstantial...For <U+2018>Cats<U+2019> fans, none of this will register.

Certain crowds appreciate it, and others don't. I would watch some clips on YouTube before seeing it to get an idea if you would like it. If you can find clips from the 1988 London cast professionally filmed version, that would probably be best. I only use the word  Confusing  in this review in that the plot is constructed around a series of poems about eclectic cats by T. S. Eliot, so the plot is not the central focus of the show, although that doesn't detract from the show either. The main attraction is the dance. The actors have near-acrobatic skill, and much of the choreography is mind-boggling. The plot is basically a talent contest among this tribe of  Jellicle cats,  and the winner each year is chosen to be  reborn.  Each cat gets their own number; and each number has a unique musical style, which makes for a very entertaining evening. Despite its quirks, there's a reason Cats has been playing worldwide since 1981!...<U+00A0>Read more Read less="

That being said, going to see this show was a total growing-up-throwback and I loved every minute of it! CATS is, in fact, a thinly veiled plot line that ALW uses as his excuse to introduce you to a bunch of different characters so he can have a musical with songs from every genre possible - and well done him. PLUS, how can you hate a show with a 20-min jazzercise routine that takes you straight into intermission. YOU CAN'T! Not if you have a soul anyway ;) I unabashedly love this show, I very much understand why many people feel quite the opposite, but if you can suspend your disbelief and ride the musical waves presented to you, you too can be as crazy as me, and love CATS. #nowandforever #letthememoryliveagain...<U+00A0>Read more Read less="
